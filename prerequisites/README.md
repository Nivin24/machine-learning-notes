# Prerequisites

This section covers the fundamental mathematical and programming concepts required before diving into machine learning algorithms.

## Topics Covered

### Mathematics
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradients, partial derivatives)
- Statistics and Probability (distributions, Bayes' theorem)
- Optimization theory

### Programming
- Python fundamentals
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Key Resources
- Khan Academy Linear Algebra course
- MIT OpenCourseWare Calculus
- Statistics courses on Coursera
- Python.org tutorial

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install required libraries: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter`
3. Review the mathematical concepts if needed
4. Complete the practice exercises in each subfolder

Move to the next sections once you're comfortable with these fundamentals.
