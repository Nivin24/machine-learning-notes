# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** learning module! This folder contains comprehensive notes and resources to help you master one of the most intuitive and widely-used machine learning algorithms.

### What is KNN?

K-Nearest Neighbors is a **non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm** used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm makes predictions by finding the K closest data points (neighbors) to a new data point and using their values to determine the output.

### Why is KNN Important?

- **Intuitive**: Easy to understand and explain - "You are the average of your neighbors"
- **Versatile**: Works for both classification and regression problems
- **No Training Phase**: Instance-based learning makes it simple to implement
- **Effective**: Performs well on many real-world datasets
- **Foundation**: Helps understand distance metrics and similarity concepts used across ML
- **Practical Applications**: Used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and anomaly detection

## 🎯 Key Concepts Summary

### Distance Metrics

- **Euclidean Distance**: Most common, works well for continuous features
- **Manhattan Distance**: Better for high-dimensional spaces and grid-like paths
- **Minkowski Distance**: Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan
- **Hamming Distance**: Ideal for categorical features

**Key Takeaway**: The choice of distance metric significantly impacts KNN performance. Select based on your data type and problem domain.

### Choosing K

- **Small K (1-3)**: Low bias, high variance - sensitive to noise
- **Large K**: High bias, low variance - smoother decision boundaries
- **Rule of Thumb**: Start with K = √n (where n is number of samples)
- **Best Practice**: Use cross-validation to find optimal K
- **Odd vs Even**: Use odd K for binary classification to avoid ties

**Key Takeaway**: K is a hyperparameter that balances model complexity and generalization. Always validate your choice.

### Applications

- **Recommendation Systems**: Product/content suggestions based on user similarity
- **Image Recognition**: Pattern matching and classification
- **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, patient similarity matching
- **Finance**: Credit scoring, fraud detection
- **Text Classification**: Document categorization, sentiment analysis

**Key Takeaway**: KNN excels when similar items should be treated similarly and when interpretability matters.

## 💡 Practical Study Tips

### For Beginners
- ✅ Start with 2D examples you can visualize
- ✅ Manually calculate distances for a few points
- ✅ Draw decision boundaries for different K values
- ✅ Use simple datasets (Iris, breast cancer) for practice
- ✅ Focus on understanding before optimizing

### For Implementation
- ✅ Always normalize/standardize features (crucial for KNN!)
- ✅ Start with Euclidean distance, experiment with others
- ✅ Use cross-validation for K selection
- ✅ Consider using KD-trees or Ball-trees for large datasets
- ✅ Handle missing values before applying KNN

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Forgetting feature scaling (KNN is distance-based!)
- ❌ Using even K for binary classification
- ❌ Ignoring computational cost for large datasets
- ❌ Not considering curse of dimensionality
- ❌ Treating all features as equally important

### Interview Preparation
