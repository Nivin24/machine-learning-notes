# Clustering

## Introduction

Clustering is a fundamental technique in **unsupervised machine learning** that groups similar data points together without requiring labeled data. It's used to discover hidden patterns, segment data, and understand the underlying structure of datasets. Clustering is widely applied in customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, document organization, and exploratory data analysis.

Unlike supervised learning where we have labels to guide the model, clustering algorithms work with unlabeled data to find natural groupings based on similarity metrics.

## Key Clustering Algorithms

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
**Type:** Partitioning-based

**How it works:**
- Randomly initializes K cluster centroids
- Assigns each point to the nearest centroid
- Recalculates centroids as the mean of assigned points
- Repeats until convergence

**Best for:**
- Large datasets with well-separated, spherical clusters
- When you know the approximate number of clusters
- Fast computation is needed

**Limitations:**
- Must specify K in advance
- Sensitive to outliers and initialization
- Assumes clusters are spherical and similar in size

---

### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**
**Type:** Hierarchical

**How it works:**
- Starts with each point as its own cluster
- Iteratively merges the closest pair of clusters
- Continues until all points are in one cluster
- Creates a dendrogram showing the merge hierarchy

**Best for:**
- Small to medium datasets
- When you need a hierarchical representation
- Exploratory analysis to understand data structure
- Don't know the number of clusters beforehand

**Limitations:**
- Computationally expensive (O(n¬≥) time complexity)
- Not scalable to very large datasets
- Once merged, clusters cannot be split

---

### 3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**
**Type:** Density-based

**How it works:**
- Finds core points with at least min_samples neighbors within radius Œµ
- Expands clusters from core points to reachable points
- Marks isolated points as noise/outliers

**Best for:**
- Arbitrary-shaped clusters (non-spherical)
- Data with noise and outliers
- Spatial data and geographic clustering
- When you don't know the number of clusters

**Limitations:**
- Struggles with varying density clusters
- Requires careful tuning of Œµ and min_samples
- Performance degrades in high dimensions

## Evaluation Metrics

### **Internal Metrics** (no ground truth needed)

| Metric | Range | Goal | Best Use Case |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|
| **Silhouette Score** | -1 to 1 | Maximize | General-purpose, intuitive |
| **Davies-Bouldin Index** | 0 to ‚àû | Minimize | Compact, well-separated clusters |
| **Calinski-Harabasz** | 0 to ‚àû | Maximize | Clear cluster separation |
| **Inertia/WCSS** | 0 to ‚àû | Minimize | K-means specifically |

### **External Metrics** (when ground truth available)
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
- Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
- Fowlkes-Mallows Index

## Tips for Mastering Clustering

1. **Always preprocess your data:** Standardize/normalize features before clustering
2. **Visualize whenever possible:** Use PCA or t-SNE for high-dimensional data
3. **Try multiple algorithms:** Different algorithms reveal different patterns
4. **Validate with multiple metrics:** Don't rely on just one evaluation metric
5. **Understand your data:** Domain knowledge helps interpret clusters
6. **Be skeptical of results:** Clustering can find patterns even in random data
7. **Document your process:** Keep track of parameters and why you chose them
8. **Compare with baselines:** Random clustering or simple rules
