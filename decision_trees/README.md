## üîë Key Mathematical Concepts

### 1. Entropy
Measures the impurity or randomness in a dataset:
```
H(S) = -‚àë(p_i * log‚ÇÇ(p_i))
```

### 2. Information Gain
Measures the reduction in entropy after splitting:
```
IG(S, A) = H(S) - ‚àë((|Sv|/|S|) * H(Sv))
```

### 3. Gini Impurity
Alternative impurity measure:
```
Gini(S) = 1 - ‚àë(p_i)¬≤
```

### 4. Splitting Criteria
- **Information Gain**: Maximizes information gained
- **Gain Ratio**: Normalizes information gain
- **Gini Index**: Minimizes weighted impurity
