# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## üìö Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are widely used in machine learning applications due to their strong theoretical foundations and excellent generalization capabilities.

**Why SVMs are Important:**
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces (works well even when dimensions > samples)
- Memory efficient (uses only support vectors for decision function)
- Versatile through different kernel functions
- Provides maximum margin classification for robust generalization
- Strong mathematical foundation based on statistical learning theory

## üßÆ Key Mathematical Concepts

### 1. **Hyperplane & Decision Boundary**
- Linear separator in n-dimensional space: `w¬∑x + b = 0`
- Divides feature space into two half-spaces
- Optimal hyperplane maximizes margin between classes

### 2. **Margin Maximization**
- **Margin**: Distance between hyperplane and nearest data points
- **Support Vectors**: Data points closest to the hyperplane
- Objective: Maximize margin = `2/||w||`

### 3. **Optimization Problem**
**Primal Form:**
```
Minimize: (1/2)||w||¬≤
Subject to: y·µ¢(w¬∑x·µ¢ + b) ‚â• 1, for all i
```

**Dual Form (using Lagrange multipliers):**
```
Maximize: Œ£Œ±·µ¢ - (1/2)Œ£Œ£Œ±·µ¢Œ±‚±ºy·µ¢y‚±º(x·µ¢¬∑x‚±º)
Subject to: Œ±·µ¢ ‚â• 0, Œ£Œ±·µ¢y·µ¢ = 0
```

### 4. **Kernel Trick**
Transforms data to higher dimensions without explicit computation:
- **Linear Kernel**: `K(x,y) = x¬∑y`
- **Polynomial Kernel**: `K(x,y) = (x¬∑y + c)·µà`
- **RBF (Gaussian) Kernel**: `K(x,y) = exp(-Œ≥||x-y||¬≤)`
- **Sigmoid Kernel**: `K(x,y) = tanh(Œ±x¬∑y + c)`

### 5. **Soft Margin (C parameter)**
Allows some misclassification for non-linearly separable data:
```
Minimize: (1/2)||w||¬≤ + C¬∑Œ£Œæ·µ¢
Subject to: y·µ¢(w¬∑x·µ¢ + b) ‚â• 1 - Œæ·µ¢, Œæ·µ¢ ‚â• 0
```
- **Large C**: Hard margin, less tolerance for errors
- **Small C**: Soft margin, more tolerance for errors

## üíª Practical Usage & Implementation

### Installation
```python
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

### Basic Implementation
```python
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Prepare data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Feature scaling (important for SVM)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train SVM
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='auto')
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Choosing the Right Kernel
1. **Linear Kernel**: Use when data is linearly separable or has many features
2. **RBF Kernel**: Default choice, works well for most cases
3. **Polynomial Kernel**: For problems with polynomial relationships
4. **Sigmoid Kernel**: Similar to neural networks

### Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto', 0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    'kernel': ['rbf', 'poly', 'sigmoid']
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm.SVC(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
```

### Best Practices
- **Always scale your features** (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)
- Start with RBF kernel and default parameters
- Use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Check for class imbalance (use `class_weight='balanced'` if needed)
- Monitor training time for large datasets
