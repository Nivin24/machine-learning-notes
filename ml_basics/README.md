# ML Basics

A gentle, beginner‑friendly introduction to core machine learning ideas with simple language, clear examples, and practical next steps.

## 1) What is Machine Learning?
- Definition: ML is about teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.
- Analogy: Like learning to recognize a friend’s face after seeing many photos.
- Why it matters vs. traditional programming:
  - Traditional: Hand‑coded rules (if/else). Works when rules are clear.
  - ML: Learns rules from examples. Works when rules are fuzzy or too many.
- Short history:
  - 1950s–70s: Early ideas (Turing Test, perceptron).
  - 1980s–90s: Decision trees, SVMs, ensembles.
  - 2010s–now: Deep learning boom (vision, speech, language), big data + GPUs.

## 2) Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
  - Definition: Learn from labeled data (inputs + correct outputs).
  - Tasks: Classification (spam/ham), Regression (price prediction).
  - Examples: Email spam filter, house price prediction.
  - Analogy: Teacher provides the right answers to learn from.
- Unsupervised Learning
  - Definition: Find structure in unlabeled data.
  - Tasks: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection.
  - Examples: Customer segmentation, topic discovery.
  - Analogy: Sorting a box of mixed buttons by shape/size without labels.
- Semi‑Supervised Learning
  - Definition: Train with a small set of labeled data + lots of unlabeled data.
  - Example: Label 1,000 images, leverage 100,000 unlabeled images.
  - Analogy: Learn a lot by exploring, occasionally checked by a tutor.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Definition: Learn actions by trial‑and‑error to maximize reward.
  - Examples: Game agents, robot navigation, ad recommendation strategies.
  - Analogy: Training a pet with treats (rewards) and feedback.

## 3) Key Terminology (Plain English)
- Feature: An input variable (e.g., “email length”, “number of links”).
- Label: The correct target/output (e.g., spam or not spam).
- Instance/Example: One row of data (one email, one customer).
- Model: The learned mapping from features to predictions.
- Algorithm: The recipe used to train a model (e.g., linear regression, random forest).
- Training: Fitting the model to data.
- Inference/Prediction: Using the trained model to output results for new data.

## 4) Data Fundamentals
- Datasets: Collections of examples with features (and sometimes labels).
- Splits:
  - Common rule of thumb: 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test.
  - Train: Fit the model.
  - Validation: Tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, depth).
  - Test: Final unbiased evaluation only once.
- Cross‑Validation (CV):
  - Idea: Rotate which part is used for validation (e.g., 5‑fold CV) to get stable estimates on small datasets.
  - Use when data is limited or when robust model comparison is needed.

## 5) Preprocessing Essentials
- Handling Missing Data
  - Options: Drop rows/columns (if few), impute with mean/median/mode, or model‑based imputation.
  - Tip: Impute within CV folds to avoid leakage.
- Feature Scaling
  - Why: Many algorithms (k‑NN, SVM, gradient descent) work better when features are on similar scales.
  - Methods: Standardization (z‑score), Min‑Max scaling to [0,1].
  - Analogy: Converting heights from feet and meters to the same units.
- Categorical Encoding
  - One‑Hot Encoding: Create a binary column per category (color_red, color_blue…). Best for nominal categories without order; beware high cardinality.
  - Label Encoding: Map categories to integers (red=0, blue=1…). OK for tree‑based models; for linear models it may imply fake order.
  - Tip: For high‑cardinality categories, consider target encoding with care (use CV and regularization).

## 6) Real‑World Examples + Ethics
- Spam Filter (Supervised)
  - Data: Emails labeled spam/ham; features like keywords, links, sender.
  - Model: Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or transformers for text.
  - Outcome: Predict spam probability; block or flag emails.
- Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised)
  - Data: Customer behavior (spend, frequency, recency, categories).
  - Model: K‑Means or hierarchical clustering.
  - Outcome: Discover groups like “bargain hunters”, “loyal big‑spenders”.
- Ethical Considerations: Bias & Fairness
  - Bias in data → biased predictions (e.g., historical hiring biases).
  - Steps: Audit datasets, track sensitive attributes, measure fairness metrics, use debiasing, keep humans‑in‑the‑loop.
  - Privacy: Anonymize, minimize data, follow regulations (GDPR/CCPA).

## 7) Getting Started: Recommended Resources
- Books/Chapters
  - “Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” (A. Géron) – beginner‑friendly.
  - “Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning” (C. Bishop) – theory.
- Courses
  - Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning (Coursera) – classic foundation.
  - DeepLearning.AI specializations for deep learning topics.

## 8) Assignment Ideas (Beginner‑Friendly)
1) Python Data Prep Mini‑Project (Pandas + Matplotlib/Seaborn)
   - Task: Load a CSV (e.g., Titanic or a Kaggle dataset), handle missing values, one‑hot encode, scale numeric features, visualize distributions and correlations.
   - Deliverables: A clean notebook with before/after tables and plots.
2) Train/Test Split + Simple Model
   - Task: Use scikit‑learn to split data (e.g., 80/20), train logistic regression or decision tree, evaluate with accuracy/F1 and a confusion matrix.
   - Stretch: Try k‑fold CV and compare results.
3) Unsupervised Segmentation
   - Task: Use K‑Means on a retail dataset to cluster customers; plot elbow curve to pick k, describe segments in plain English.
4) Ethics Reflection
   - Task: Pick a dataset with potential sensitive attributes; discuss possible biases, fairness checks, and mitigation steps.

## 9) Quick Start Code Snippets (sklearn)
- Train/Test Split + Baseline Model
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load data
# df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
# Example: assume df has features X_cols and label y_col
X = df[X_cols].copy()
y = df[y_col].copy()

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Scale numeric features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate
pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, pred))
```

- One‑Hot Encoding with Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
# df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
cat_cols = ['color', 'country']
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=cat_cols, drop_first=True)
```

- K‑Means Clustering
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_numeric)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, n_init='auto', random_state=42)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
df['cluster'] = labels
```

## 10) Tips for Success
- Start simple: Baseline first, iterate later.
- Keep a clean pipeline: Same preprocessing for train and test.
- Document decisions: Note data cleaning steps and parameter choices.
- Visualize: Plots reveal issues quickly.
- Reproducibility: Set random seeds, save notebooks and model configs.
