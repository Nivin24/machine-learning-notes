# Linear Regression: Extra Notes

- Always inspect feature correlations before fitting.
- Outliers can heavily influence model fit.
- Regularization (Ridge, Lasso) addresses overfitting.
- Gradient descent is useful when the number of features is large.
- Analytical (normal equation) is efficient for small datasets.
